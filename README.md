# EctoLock

This is a companion repository for my [Database Locking with Ecto in Elixir](https://medium.com/flatiron-labs/database-locking-with-ecto-in-elixir-9804cdbd1866) blog post.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:

- Ensure Postgres is installed and running
- Ensure Elixir 1.7 or higher is installed

### Setup

- `mix deps.get`
- `mix ecto.create`
- `mix ecto.migrate`

You're all set! Feel free to hop into an iex session (`iex -S mix`) to play around!
